Sure! Here's an example of a README file for a Titanic survival prediction project on Github¹:


# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This analysis aimed to create a prediction model that predict the survival of titanic's passengers. The python scripts are tested and run on Spyder (Python 3.8). Prediction submitted to Kaggle gained public score of 0.78229. Simple web application is created using Streamlit and Heroku at the end of the analysis.

## Files

- `titanicPrediction.py: python file containing actual code.
- `predictions.csv`: the output file containing predicted suvival for test dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains details of each passenger in the titanic ship and whether they survived or not.

## Methodology

The project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a passenger would survive or not.

## Results

The prediction submitted to Kaggle gained public score of 0.78229.
